# Diarys
Diarys is a smart application for school that helps you with everyday task.

### Highlights
- Smart Screens: app knows when you're in school and when you're at home (means your lessons have ended) and automatically shows you appropriate screen for a given time when you launch the app. 
For example, if you want to see schedule in school first, you can set this up, or set screen with your tasks to show up when you're outside of school.  
Also, you can turn on special feature that automatically shows screen for adding new homework tasks right when you lauch the app!
- Recomendations. Besides tasks for tomorrow and full list of tasks, Diarys also generates a list of tasks that are considered good to be done if you have free time. The priority of the tasks calculated by the date (how far a given task from today) and subjective complexity of the task (the harder the more priority)
- Typing hints that are based on the schedule (when you type, it pulls subject names from the schedule)
- Resolving a date for next lesson for a given subject when adding new task. You don't need to search for a date of the lesson (however, you can do this), just type in the name of the subject and Diarys will resolve date for the next lesson!
